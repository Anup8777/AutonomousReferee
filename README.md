# Autonomous Referee System Project - MSD2021

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

The goal of the project is to develop an autonomous referee system for soccer robots which can satisfy the following goal:

*"The final goal is to have a 5 minute long 2 against 2 robot soccer game, using the Tech United turtles, refereed by the system described above, which receives a positive recommendation by an experienced human referee. By positive recommendation we mean that the human referee acknowledges that the provided refereeing system, for that 5 minute long game, refereed the match well."*

The full description of the project can be found under docs/[autoref_2122 comments RD.pdf](https://github.com/Anup8777/AutonomousReferee/blob/main/docs/autoref_2122%20comments%20RD.pdf "autoref_2122 comments RD.pdf")


<!-- Feasibility Analysis -->
## Feasibility Studies
In order to develop the autonomous referee system different technologies have been taken into considerastion as follow:
- Using simulation
- Using Drone + Camera
- Using surveillance cameras to record the match
- Using Turtles (Tech United soccer robots)

<!-- System Architecture -->
## System Architecture

The **Architecture Description** dcoument can be found in the following folder: docs/[Architecture](https://github.com/Anup8777/AutonomousReferee/tree/main/docs/Architecture "Architecture")

The Architecture Description document covers the following topic:
- Introduction
- Stakeholders and Concerns
- Environment Analysis
- Models and Views

<!-- Implementation -->
## Implementation and Validation

The developed code in MATLAB for the Task 1 and Task 2 can be found in the following folder in GitHub repository: AutonomousReferee/[src](https://github.com/Anup8777/AutonomousReferee/tree/main/src "src")
 
For example, the developed codes can be used to detect the violation in the follwoing two scenarios.
 
### Task1: Ball Out of Play
Determine if the ball is in or out of pitch (BOOP).
